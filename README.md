# Question
Imagine that you wake up, check your email, and you see an interesting task: Polygon is asking you to design a new zkSNARK circuit that implements some logical operations. You need to implement the circuit and deploy a verifier on-chain to verify proofs generated from this circuit

For this project, you will create a circuit using the circom programming language that implements the following logical gate: Your goal is to prove you know the inputs A (0) & B (1) that yield a 0 output.

# Commands used in gitpod
1) npm i
2) npm hardhat clean
3) npx hardhat circom
4) npx hardhat compile
5) npm install dotenv
6) npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai

# Precautions
Create env file for private keys

# Result
Output as **TRUE**
